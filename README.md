# Blind-Stick-ESP32-
This project is a smart blind-assist system built around the ESP32. It combines obstacle detection, fire sensing, environmental monitoring, GPS tracking, voice time announcements, an online dashboard, and automated RTC updates through NTP. The goal is to help users navigate safely and allow caregivers to monitor them remotely.
